## 📂 Repository Structure

This project is broken down into three main stages, each corresponding to a day of the masterclass:

- **Day1_Basics_Fouzia_Ashfaq.xlsx:**  
  Focuses on the fundamentals. This file demonstrates core Excel skills, including:
  - Essential formulas (`IF`, `IFS`, `SUMIF`, `COUNTIF`)
  - Proper data formatting, including tables, number formats, and borders
  - Application of conditional formatting for at-a-glance analysis

- **Day2_Lookups_Fouzia_Ashfaq.xlsx:**  
  Represents the critical data cleaning and preparation phase. This file showcases:
  - Importing messy data from a CSV into Power Query
  - Applying a series of transformations to clean, reshape, and format the data (e.g., removing nulls, splitting columns, correcting data types)
  - Loading the cleaned data into the Power Pivot Data Model

- **Day3_Fouzia_Ashfaq.xlsx:**  
  The culmination of the project—an interactive dashboard. This file includes:
  - A robust Data Model in Power Pivot
  - Calculated measures using DAX (`SUMX`, `CALCULATE`, `DIVIDE`) to derive key performance indicators (KPIs)
  - An interactive dashboard built with PivotTables and PivotCharts
  - Slicers to dynamically filter the entire report by region, product category, and salesperson
